# realtime-operating-system-kernel-on-AVR-AtMega32-and-piano-waveform-player

This is an unfinished project on ATmega32 micro-controller

ATmega32 has 2k memory and 32K Flash Rom with 8Mhz~16Mhz 8bit processor

The Realtime operating system kernal with timeslice multitask switch is finished and tested works fine.

The piano timbre waveform player is using the microcontrolled's timer interupt to make sound incorporate pre-defined
piano timbre data array. The playing part works somehow but it is not perfectly. I guess the method of integrating piano
timbre is not quite right. Wait sometime to fix it.

The integration with RTOS and waveform performer has not been done yet.
